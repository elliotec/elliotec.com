    <h1>Building This Site</h1>
      <h2>Blogging platforms vs. static site generators</h2>

<p>I had been looking around for a good way to get a portfolio site and blogging platform all in one that suited my tastes. </p>

<p>For a short time I looked into platforms such as <a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a>, <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a>, and <a href="http://svbtle.com">Svbtle</a>. </p>

<p>I really liked the design, simplicity, and content-focus of those, but as a developer, I wanted something I could get my hands dirty with and design myself with minimal third-party interference. </p>

<p>Then I found <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. I quickly realized that what I wanted was a &ldquo;blog-aware&rdquo; static site generator rather than a blogging platform alone. This would give me the ability to fully customize every aspect of my site while allowing me a place to write posts (bonus points for the fact that I&rsquo;m writing the posts in my text editor!).</p>

<p>I had Jekyll installed and running on a development server in a minute or two. I was able to acquaint myself with the directory structure fairly quickly after going through the docs a bit and looking at some example sites - my favorite of which is <a href="http://quaran.to">quaran.to</a>, the personal blog of Nick Quaranto.</p>

<p>It uses the <a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid Templating Engine</a>, which is a &ldquo;Ruby library for rendering safe templates which cannot affect the security of the server they are rendered on.&rdquo; It looks remarkably like erb in Handlebars. It didn&rsquo;t take much getting used to, but I was slightly annoyed that a Ruby-driven framework wasn&rsquo;t just using erb. </p>

<p>In addition to that slight inconvenience, I had to use the pre-release version of Jekyll in order to have Sass and CoffeeScript support - not a huge deal until I found the hard way that if hosting on Github pages (one of Jekyll&rsquo;s major selling points), you are limited to the version they use.</p>

<p>So my options were thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a Rake task that compiles Sass and CoffeeScript</li>
<li>Use and configure plugins</li>
<li>Wait for Jekyll 2.0 to be released and then Github Pages to adopt it</li>
<li>Use a different generator</li>
</ul>

<p>All the options seemed annoying at the time.</p>

<h2>Finding Middleman</h2>

<p>I had all but given up on Jekyll (Sass is VERY important to me) when 2.0 was released. I was excited, but a bit disillusioned. I found out from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7708142">This Hacker News Post</a>, and lo and behold the top comment was the elusive solution to all my static site-generating problems: <a href="http://middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a>.</p>

<p>Middleman&rsquo;s file structure was immediately familiar and it&rsquo;s Rails-like atmosphere sold me instantly. erb instead of Liquid-Ruby-Handlebars? Check. Sass and CoffeeScript support out of the box? Check. Ability to host on Github Pages, Heroku, or any other production environment imaginable with little configuration? Check, check, and check.</p>

<p>Now I could finally get to the fun part and design my site. I came accross these two posts that were immensely helpful:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://fajitanachos.com/Goodbye-jekyll/">FajitaNachos&rsquo;s post entitled &lsquo;Goodbye Jekyll&rsquo;</a> </li>
</ul>

<p><em>This was also a huge inspiration for the actual design of my site and I blatantly ripped off a few aspects that I&rsquo;m really happy with. Andrew, if you&rsquo;re reading this, you are admired and respected and I thank you for this post and your site.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/middleman-bourbon-walkthrough">Thoughtbot&rsquo;s post entitled &lsquo;Styling a Middleman Blog with Bourbon, Neat, and Bitters&rsquo;</a></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Though I had long admired Thoughtbot for their amazing work and invaluable blog content, this post in particular sent me down a rabbit hole that guided my evolution into a bona fide Thoughtbot fanboy. Seriously.</em></p>

<p>What you see here is the result of this process. In a future post, I&rsquo;ll describe some of the methodology I used in the site&rsquo;s creation and give some code samples and tips I found useful in it&rsquo;s development. In the meantime, check out the code on <a href="http://github.com/elliotec/middleman">my Github</a> if you wish.</p>
