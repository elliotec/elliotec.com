    <p>In May, my wife Tiffany was looking online browsing through houses on Utah Real Estate randomly on a Saturday night. We had talked about buying a house, but were working on saving up for a down payment that would be a substantial percentage of our $400k maximum budget. We were planning on 2017, because we spent the equivalent of a down payment on our honeymoon to Iceland, Denmark, and Norway the year before and wanted to find the perfect one that would last us for a very long time.</p>

<p>But that night in May, at 1 o&#39;clock in the morning on a Saturday night, our plans got moved forward quite a bit. She saw this house in the neighborhood in downtown that we&rsquo;ve loved since high school and had since become quite desirable. We almost never looked in the neighborhood because houses around there were going for hundreds of thousands of dollars more than our maximum budget. But here was one, with an asking price of $320k - well below our budget - in the perfect spot of the perfect neighborhood, with a nice yard, shop, and mother-in-law apartment, my only stipulations.</p>

<p>The one caveat was that it hadn&rsquo;t been updated in almost 30 years, and the previous owners put a lot of wear and tear on it without a lot of care.</p>
