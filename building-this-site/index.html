I quickly realized that what I wanted was a &ldquo;blog-aware&rdquo; static site generator rather than a blogging platform alone. This would give me the ability to fully customize every aspect of my site while allowing me a place to write posts.</p> <p>I had Jekyll installed and running on a development server in a minute or two. I was able to acquaint myself with the directory structure fairly quickly after going through the docs a bit and looking at some example sites - my favorite of which is <a href="//quaran.to">quaran.to</a>, the personal blog of Nick Quaranto.</p> <p>It uses the <a href="//liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid Templating Engine</a>, which is a &ldquo;Ruby library for rendering safe templates which cannot affect the security of the server they are rendered on.&rdquo; It looks remarkably like erb in Handlebars. It didn&rsquo;t take much getting used to, but I was slightly annoyed that a Ruby-driven framework wasn&rsquo;t just using erb.</p> <p>In addition to that slight inconvenience, I had to use the pre-release version of Jekyll in order to have Sass and CoffeeScript support - not a huge deal until I found the hard way that if hosting on Github pages (one of Jekyll&rsquo;s major selling points), you are limited to the version they use.</p> <p>So my options were:</p> <ul> <li>Write a Rake task that compiles Sass and CoffeeScript</li> <li>Use and configure plugins</li> <li>Wait for Jekyll 2.0 to be released and then Github Pages to adopt it</li> <li>Use a different generator</li> </ul> <h2>Finding Middleman</h2> <p>I had all but given up on Jekyll when 2.0 was released. I was excited, but a bit disillusioned. I found out from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7708142">This Hacker News Post</a>, and the top comment was the elusive solution to all my static site-generating problems: <a href="//middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a>.</p> <p>Middleman&rsquo;s file structure was immediately familiar and it&rsquo;s Rails-like atmosphere sold me instantly. erb instead of Liquid-Ruby-Handlebars? Check. Sass and CoffeeScript support out of the box? Check. Ability to host on Github Pages, Heroku, or any other production environment imaginable with little configuration? Check, check, and check.</p> <p>Now I could finally get to the fun part and design my site. I came accross these two posts that were immensely helpful:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href="//fajitanachos.com/Goodbye-jekyll/">FajitaNachos&rsquo;s post entitled &lsquo;Goodbye Jekyll&rsquo;</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="//robots.thoughtbot.com/middleman-bourbon-walkthrough">Thoughtbot&rsquo;s post entitled &#39;Styling a Middleman Blog with Bourbon, Neat, and Bitters&rsquo;</a></p></li> </ul> <p>What you see here is the result of this process. In a future post, I&rsquo;ll describe some of the methodology I used in the site&rsquo;s creation and give some code samples and tips I found useful in it&rsquo;s development.
