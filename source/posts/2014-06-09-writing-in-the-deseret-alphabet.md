## The State of Deseret

This past weekend I went camping in the [San Rafael Swell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Rafael_Swell) and became interested in my native state of Utah's history and unique culture.

Evidence of humans is found in Utah for as far back as 12,000 years ago. Various Native American tribes and cultures (Freemont, Puebloan, etc.) solely occupied the land until the first of the Mormon pioneers arrived with their leader [Brigham Young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young) in 1847.

They settled in by vastly changing the desert environment into a habitable landscape with amazing feats of industry including irrigation and agriculture, timber and mining, and constructing communities from the resources around them. They created a society from scratch.

The settlers were very isolated and in a political and territorial limbo that went from technically belonging to Mexico, to a near immediate statehood proposal ([The State of Deseret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Deseret)), and then remaining a U.S. territory - all the while settling most of the western United States including cities like Las Vegas, San Bernardino, most of Idaho and Nevada, a good chunk of Arizona and many other western states. 

Brigham Young and the Mormons were the de-facto government throughout this time (some say they still are) and as such were providing public nessecities like schooling, and founded the precursor to the University of Utah, the University of Deseret.

## The Deseret Alphabet

This was a time when there were several efforts to reform the traditional Latin English alphabet into something phonetic, more easily learnable by immigrants and children, and optimized for handwriting. Brigham Young and the board of regents of the University of Deseret saw their position as an opportunity to get in on this action. 

In addition to the aformentioned reasons for alphabet refrom, the Mormon leadership believed a new writing system would benefit them in other ways such as more unification, solidifying their unique identity, and some speculate that there was a bit of a secret-keeping draw to it as well, though that claim has been refuted by several scholars.

[The Deseret Alphabet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deseret_alphabet) was developed over the course of several years and iterations beginning before the pioneers made their way accross the plains, and finally had its first printing in 1859 by the [Deseret News](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deseret_News). Periodic sample prints of the alphabet came in the newspaper until the first books were published in the late 1860's which sold very poorly. The alphabet died with Brigham Young in 1877.

It is amazing how much research there is on the Deseret Alphabet, with how few people seem to know about it. There has even been [an effort to print many classic literary masterpieces](http://www.deseretalphabet.info/classics/) in the alphabet. It was introduced in Unicode in 2001, allowing for hobbyists, linguists, and historians to use the alphabet more easily.

## Learning the alphabet

Here's a pronunciation table:


| Glyph | IPA  | Sound| Glyph | IPA | Sound|
|-------|------|-------------|-------|-----|-------------|
| 𐐀    | /iː/ |  "e" in me   | 𐐊    | /ʌ/|  "u" in luck |
| 𐐁    | /eɪ/ | "ay" in day  | 𐐋    | /ʊ/ |  "u" in pull |
| 𐐂    | /ɑː/ | "a" in cart | 𐐌    | /aɪ/|  "y" in my |
| 𐐃    | /ɔː/ | "au" in caught | 𐐍 | /aʊ/ | "ow" in cow |
| 𐐄    | /oʊ/ |  "o" in go  | 𐐎    | /w/ |  "w" in wow |
| 𐐅    | /uː/ | "oo" in do | 𐐏    | /j/ |  "y" in yes |
| 𐐆    | /ɪ/  |  "i" in sit | 𐐐    | /h/ |  "h" in hi |
| 𐐇    | /ɛ/  |  "e" in bet | 𐐑  | /p/ | "p" in pet  |
| 𐐈    | /æ/  | "a" in cat   | 𐐒  | /b/ | "b" in boy |
| 𐐉    | /ɒ/  |  "o" in lot | 𐐓   | /t/ |  "t" in tank |

| Glyph | IPA  | Sound| Glyph | IPA | Sound|
|-------|------|-------------|-------|-----|-------------|
| 𐐔    | /d/ |  "d" in dog  | 𐐞    | /z/ | "z" in zoo |
| 𐐕    | /tʃ/ |"ch" in church| 𐐟    | /ʃ/ | "sh" in ship |
| 𐐖    | /dʒ/ | "j" in jump  | 𐐠    | /ʒ/ | "s" in measure |
| 𐐗    | /k/ | "k" in kite  | 𐐡    | /r/ |  "r" in red |
| 𐐘    | /ɡ/ |  "g" in girl | 𐐢    | /l/ | "l" in love |
| 𐐙    | /f/ |  "f" in food | 𐐣    | /m/ |  "m" in mom |
| 𐐚    | /v/  | "v" in voice | 𐐤    | /n/ | "n" in night  |
| 𐐛    | /θ/  | "th" in think | 𐐥    | /ŋ/ | "ng" in sing |
| 𐐜    | /ð/  | "th" in that | 𐐦    | /ɔɪ/|  "oy" in boy  |
| 𐐝    | /s/  | "s" in sun  | 𐐧    | /juː/ | "yew" in yew  |



So, ostensibly thats kind of a lot. 40 new unique characters and sounds to replace a very well known system seems a bit daunting, which may be part of the reason it had a hard time getting adopted by the intended users and audience. 

In my opinion, other than the glyphs looking nothing at all like thier roman-counterparts, the alphabet is rather easy to learn since you are just reassigning a symbol to a sound in English. There is no grammar or syntax change, it's really just like mind-mapping 40 pictures to 40 words for which a few hours of flash card study would be quite sufficient.

## Limitations of the alphabet

The alphabet in its official form was created to emulate the pronunciation of the settlers, who came primarily from New England. This means when you read out loud a publication in the Deseret Alphabet, it's going to sound like you're talking with the accent of a North Easterner in the 1860's. 

A good example of change is "𐐃", which in present-day Utah essentially doesn't exist. Think of a Long Island native saying something like "I thought you caught it when you fought it," or something along those lines. You know what I mean about the vowels in those words being non-existant and replaced simply with "ah" in the western United States.

Another limitation is the lack of a schwa (/ə/) vowel. It sounds like the "e" in "the." Historically the schwa has been written as 𐐊, which I find odd since the symbol 𐐋 is much closer in my opinion. My blog, my rules, so I'll use 𐐋 as the schwa from now on.

## Now for the fun part

I wasn't satisfied with the default unicode Deseret font, so I went about scouring the web for better ones. I had a lot of trouble finding a good sans-serif font. The primary resource for these and the serif fonts I found were by [Joshua Erickson](http://copper.chem.ucla.edu/~jericks/index.html), but alas, the entire sans-serif collection has been disabled. Bummer. At least I could use some of his serif fonts that were less harsh on the eyes than the default, and there were a few sans-serif fonts his site led me to. Here are a few font samples in addition to the default unicode font you see above in the chart:



<p class="adamic">1. 𐐈𐐔𐐈𐐣𐐆𐐗𐐒𐐀： 𐐀𐐁𐐂𐐃𐐄𐐅𐐆𐐇𐐈𐐉𐐊𐐋𐐌𐐍𐐎𐐏𐐐𐐑𐐒𐐓𐐔𐐕𐐖𐐗𐐘𐐙𐐚𐐛𐐜𐐝𐐞𐐠𐐡𐐢𐐣𐐤𐐥𐐦𐐧𐐟 </p>

<p class="huney">2. H_NIBI：ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZŽÀÁÂÃÊÎÐÑÔÕÛÞ </p>

<p class="deseret-sans">3. DEZÒRET: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZÅÆÈÊÌÍÒØÛŒˉ </p>

Unfortunately 2 and 3 (the two sans-serif) are mapped to two seperate and seemingly arbitrary encodings rather than the proper Deseret unicode characters like the serif font at the top of that list. So even though 2 (HuneyBee) is my favorite of the three, its nowhere near as easy to implement as 1 (AdamicBee). 

Here is the HTML source of those example fonts:

```html
<p class="adamic">1. 𐐈𐐔𐐈𐐣𐐆𐐗𐐒𐐀： 𐐀𐐁𐐂𐐃𐐄𐐅𐐆𐐇𐐈𐐉𐐊𐐋𐐌𐐍𐐎𐐏𐐐𐐑𐐒𐐓𐐔𐐕𐐖𐐗𐐘𐐙𐐚𐐛𐐜𐐝𐐞𐐠𐐡𐐢𐐣𐐤𐐥𐐦𐐧𐐟</p>

<p class="huney">2. H_NIBI：ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZŽÀÁÂÃÊÎÐÑÔÕÛÞ</p>

<p class="deseret-sans">3. DEZÒRET: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZÅÆÈÊÌÍÒØÛŒˉ</p>

```

As you can see, 1 is in the proper Deseret unicode, and 2 and 3... aren't. Maybe they are relics of the pre-unicode days of Deseret, but either way I'll be leaving them out when trying to write in it.

Almost all of the fonts I tried were one .ttf file and I needed to convert them to web fonts. This was ridiculously easy with [FontPrep](http://fontprep.com/). All I had to do was drag the .ttf file onto the app, and it generated a whole package of web font formats with the corresponding CSS. I highly recommend that app if you ever need to generate custom web fonts.

While I'm at it, I may as well explain how I got these custom fonts to work in the asset pipeline using Sass.

First, I created a /fonts directory where the rest of my asset directories are:

```unix
(Middleman)
-source
  -fonts
  -images
  -javascripts
  -stylesheets
  ...etc

(Rails)
-app
  -assets
    -fonts
    -images
    -javascripts
    -stylesheets
```

Next, FontPrep generates four files when it recieves a .ttf- .eot, .svg, .woff, and another .ttf. I put these files in the /fonts directory for all three fonts I'm using (not including default unicode, obviously):

```unix
-source
  -fonts
    -AdamicBee.eot
    -AdamicBee.svg
    -AdamicBee.woff
    -AdamicBee.ttf
    -Huneybee.eot
    -Huneybee.svg
    -Huneybee.woff
    -Huneybee.ttf
    -deseret.eot
    -deseret.svg
    -deseret.woff
    -deseret.ttf
```

Since I'm using [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io), I can use the magnificent font-face mixin (I'm also using [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io), so I placed these 3 lines at the bottom of the _typography.scss partial):

```scss
@include font-face('Huneybee', '/fonts/Huneybee');
@include font-face('AdamicBee', '/fonts/AdamicBee');
@include font-face('deseret', '/fonts/deseret');
```
This compiles the following CSS:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'HuneyBee';
  src: url('/fonts/Huneybee.eot'); /* IE9 Compat Modes */
  src: url('/fonts/Huneybee.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'), /* IE6-IE8 */
       url('/fonts/Huneybee.woff') format('woff'), /* Modern Browsers */
       url('/fonts/Huneybee.ttf')  format('truetype'), /* Safari, Android, iOS */
       url('/fonts/Huneybee.svg#aa041304602ddc161943388b95e8c94f') format('svg'); /* Legacy iOS */
       
  font-style:   normal;
  font-weight:  400;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'AdamicBee';
  src: url('/fonts/AdamicBee.eot'); /* IE9 Compat Modes */
  src: url('/fonts/AdamicBee.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'), /* IE6-IE8 */
       url('/fonts/AdamicBee.woff') format('woff'), /* Modern Browsers */
       url('/fonts/AdamicBee.ttf')  format('truetype'), /* Safari, Android, iOS */
       url('/fonts/AdamicBee.svg#159e7fbb74bf1cefffafc0996ebf38fb') format('svg'); /* Legacy iOS */
       
  font-style:   normal;
  font-weight:  400;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Deseret-sans';
  src: url('/fonts/deseret.eot'); /* IE9 Compat Modes */
  src: url('/fonts/deseret.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'), /* IE6-IE8 */
       url('/fonts/deseret.woff') format('woff'), /* Modern Browsers */
       url('/fonts/deseret.ttf')  format('truetype'), /* Safari, Android, iOS */
       url('/fonts/deseret.svg#c44a3474510e076f453a95eeee3a1178') format('svg'); /* Legacy iOS */
       
  font-style:   normal;
  font-weight:  400;
}
```
Thats about as bullet-proof cross-browser compatible as you can get. A good example for why I think Sass is indespensible in modern web development. 3 simple scss lines compile to 34 lines of css with the best of the best practices.
