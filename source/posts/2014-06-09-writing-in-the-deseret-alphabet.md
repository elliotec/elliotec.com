## The State of Deseret

This past weekend I went camping in the [San Rafael Swell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Rafael_Swell) and became interested in my native state of Utah's history and unique culture.

Evidence of humans is found in Utah for as far back as 12,000 years ago. Various Native American tribes and cultures (Freemont, Puebloan, etc.) solely occupied the land until the first of the Mormon pioneers arrived with their leader [Brigham Young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young) in 1847.

They settled in by vastly changing the desert environment into a habitable landscape with amazing feats of industry including irrigation and agriculture, timber and mining, and constructing communities from the resources around them. They created a society from scratch.

The settlers were very isolated and in a political and territorial limbo that went from technically belonging to Mexico, to a near immediate statehood proposal ([The State of Deseret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Deseret)), and then remaining a U.S. territory - all the while settling most of the western United States including cities like Las Vegas, San Bernardino, most of Idaho and Nevada, a good chunk of Arizona and many other western states. 

Brigham Young and the Mormons were the de-facto government throughout this time (some say they still are) and as such were providing public nessecities like schooling, and founded the precursor to the University of Utah, the University of Deseret.

## The Deseret Alphabet

This was a time when there were several efforts to reform the traditional Latin English alphabet into something phonetic, more easily learnable by immigrants and children, and optimized for handwriting. Brigham Young and the board of regents of the University of Deseret saw their position as an opportunity to get in on this action. 

In addition to the aformentioned reasons for alphabet refrom, the Mormon leadership believed a new writing system would benefit them in other ways such as more unification, solidifying their unique identity, and some speculate that there was a bit of a secret-keeping draw to it as well, though that claim has been refuted by several scholars.

[The Deseret Alphabet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deseret_alphabet) was developed over the course of several years and iterations beginning before the pioneers made their way accross the plains, and finally had its first printing in 1859 by the [Deseret News](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deseret_News). Periodic sample prints of the alphabet came in the newspaper until the first books were published in the late 1860's which sold very poorly. The alphabet died with Brigham Young in 1877.

It is amazing how much research there is on the Deseret Alphabet, with how few people seem to know about it. There has even been [an effort to print many classic literary masterpieces](http://www.deseretalphabet.info/classics/) in the alphabet. It was introduced in Unicode in 2001, allowing for hobbyists, linguists, and historians to use the alphabet more easily.
