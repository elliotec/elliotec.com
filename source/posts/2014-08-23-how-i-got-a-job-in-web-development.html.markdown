## Why I'm writing this

This post is an attempt to explain how I got a position as a professional web developer with only just over a year of experience programming and a degree in psychology. I'm writing in hopes that it will help anyone else along a similar path, or those who don't know where to start. This is by no means a surefire plan to get anyone a job in a year or ever. But maybe someone aspiring to become a web developer can take a few resources or find something useful here.

## My first exposure

As far as I knew growing up, the Internet was made out of magic. I had taken apart my family computers out of curiosity a few times but had never heard of HTML, or pondered the concept of what software development really was. Most of the technical experience in my life was my enjoyment of building and breaking things, playing with Knex and Erector sets, and growing up with the Internet. Just after high school I was lucky enough to land a job as a contractor for my neighbor soldering circuit boards and electronics for various products he made.

That was a pretty cool job, but it certainly didn't make me want to study electrical engineering. I went into psychology thinking it would supplement my intent of going to medical school and becoming a psychiatrist. That dream died fast for numerous reasons, and I ended up rushing to finish my degree ASAP, then started work at Starbucks after leaving my student job upon graduation.

There are pros and cons to working at Starbucks, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to stick around forever. Career-wise I was open to whatever at the time and didn't have much direction. While poking around on Reddit in January of 2013, I had vaguely been introduced to the idea of web development and coding by a particular post (which I have tragically not since been able to find), and it piqued my interest to research it further. Thats when I learned that I was basically "coding" when I followed an extensive process ([soon thereafter replaced by this](http://lifehacker.com/5830367/how-to-hack-your-wii-for-homebrew-in-five-minutes)) haphazardly copypasting weird long strings of symbols in college to mod my Wii so I could play all the games.

That same month I learned about [Linux](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and decided to install [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop) on an old Dell I inherited from my parents. In order to get things installed and working properly I had to open the command line and actually use Unix commands, some of them often enough to start understanding what they did and remembering them. I was just getting into Minecraft at the time and wanted my girlfriend to play with me, and I figured with a little googling it would be easy enough to setup a local server on that Ubuntu machine. It was, and I consider that my first real and aware exposure to programming.

## Finding the time

Over the next few months I dabbled in various tutorials on HTML and CSS recommended by Reddit but struggled finding time and motivation to just sit down and get through them. I attempted to complete the Codecademy courses multiple times but found them boring and purposeless. The idea sort of went to the back burner as I worked full-time, moved into a new place, and wanted to relax and enjoy my time off. I was doing just that at the climbing gym on June 1st when I clumsily stumbled off the mat at the base of the wall and dramatically broke the cartilage in my ankle. Somehow I didn't need surgery but the doctor said it had to be non-weight bearing for 12 weeks.

So I called my boss and broke the news, she reminded me of one of the aforementioned "pros" of working at Starbucks: Short-term disability insurance. It got signed off no problem. The first couple weeks were mostly spent sleeping away the pain and playing through various video games, pretty much just lazing around. But one day when the Lortab wore off I was feeling very unproductive and lazy, so I decided to set a goal of getting through those HTML and CSS Codecademy courses the next week. At the same time we moved into my girlfriend's parents' house while they were abroad so that eliminated rent and some other expenses for the few months I was out. I became acutely aware of how extremely fortunate I was to be in a position where I was essentially getting paid to chill at home and have 3 months of free time to spend however I wanted.

This awareness led me to feel like I owed it to karma or whatever powers that were to spend a good chunk of my time out on productive endeavors and keep setting goals like the Codecademy one. I blew through those courses, still feeling annoyed with their seeming lack of purpose and context, but appreciated the introduction to something I knew I wanted to spend more time on.

## Learning front end fundamentals

I soon asked the almighty Google for some more of the top HTML & CSS resources. It wasn't long before I saw the book, aptly titled [HTML & CSS](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/), by Jon Duckett. I chose this book almost exclusively based on the way it looks. The design wowed me, and the content was just what I was looking for. Rather than the piecemeal abstractions and micro lessons on Codecademy, I found Duckett's book to be a refreshing whole-picture approach with real world examples. I went through it in a week and built finished a custom, useful website from scratch for the first time the following week. I credit this book with teaching me a lot of the foundational knowledge I needed to learn further concepts and build upon.

My next step was to search through my network for advice. I thought of everyone I knew, parsed through my Facebook friends, and found someone I could contact that I knew was involved in the industry. So I messaged him and told him about my interest and quickly got a response. He happened to be in a senior position at a very well known company but took the time to give me a little project to work on with a loose deadline. Still being in the first third of my confinement to the couch, I was able to spend two weeks working exclusively on this. I learned a lot about modern best practices and got some great career advice.

## Rails and a development environment

At this point I felt comfortable enough to tell my friends and family about my pursuit, and let them know that I was looking for work and projects. A good friend gave me the login to a tutorial series called [One Month Rails](http://onemonth.com) he bought but never found time for. I certainly had time for it, so I did it.

This tutorial introduced me to a vast world that I'd never seen before. It guided me through setting up a development environment that consisted primarily of [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) and the command line, and helped me get a bunch of other tools set up. I learned about version control and [git](http://git-scm.com) (and by extension, [Github](http://github.com)) through repetition in the course, and got a grasp on most aspects of the tech stack in Rails. I finished it in about 2 weeks and had a fully functioning app replicating Pintrest, hosted on [Heroku](http://heroku.com).

I used jQuery a little bit during the tutorial, which was a nice intro to JavaScript. I realized how useful and necessary it is and wanted to use some other plugins in my future projects.

## Starting a freelancing business

I was super excited about programming and my new prospects for income. I decided I wanted to start a freelance business doing this, and my first step was getting some more projects and clients. The first few were not as hard to get as I had been led to believe. My family and friends already knew I was doing this, so I asked some of them if they needed a website.

I did one for free, one as a trade, and then started charging (not very much). My first three clients were close friends or family, and after that I indiscriminately offered my services to anyone and everyone. One of my first non-family/friend clients was an HVAC contractor that was fixing the furnace in the house I was renting at the time. He saw me working on a different project, asked what I was doing, and told me he needed a website. I gave him a cheap quote, and promptly had another check in my pocket.

It was time to legitimize my business; I had started making enough money to open up a bank account and register a sole proprietorship. I finally got around to making myself a (pretty rudimentary) personal website and got my girlfriend's help in designing a logo in Illustrator. We designed business cards at the same time and got a cheap bulk order from FedEx. I still use them and they look like this:

<img class="cards" src="../images/cardfront.png">

Little did I know that these cards would be instrumental in getting me my current job.

##Expediting my learning

I continued to get a client here and there after my ankle had fully healed and I started work again full time at Starbucks. It wasn't enough to pay the bills though, and at this point I was dedicated to becoming a professional web developer. I looked around for some dev roles in my area and came up short. Most required a level of proficiency that I wasn't totally confident I had.

I mentioned to the same friend who introduced me to the Rails tutorial that I wanted to somehow expedite my learning to get to a professional skill level. He told me about these "code bootcamps" that had been popping up around the country taking after the tech company incubator model and their apparent success. He had been working at a venture impact fund, and was tasked to get information about these schools for possible investments. He emailed me a spreadsheet with some basic info about each bootcamp he looked into (which was immensely helpful - something similar with can now be found [here](http://www.skilledup.com/learn/programming/the-ultimate-guide-to-coding-bootcamps-the-exhaustive-list/)) and I did my own research on which would be the best for me.

That October, after much deliberation I decided to apply to [Code Fellows](www.codefellows.org) in Seattle. I chose this particular code school mainly because they guaranteed a job in software development within 9 months or I paid nothing. Another reason was its relatively low price compared to some of the others like Hack Reactor, which at the time I was applying was $20,000 plus the cost and hassle of moving to San Fransisco. Also, I had never been to Seattle and was in great need of an adventure to a place I had heard only good things about.

The application and interview process was pretty intense. After an initial application assessing my skills and aptitude I was moved on to another stage that required a submission of a one-minute video of me explaining "something technical." I chose jQuery and probably did it 50 times before feeling I had done an adequate job. I soon got another email requesting a time for an interview, and I got on Skype with the CEO at the alloted time. The interview went absolutely terrible. There were connectivity issues which amplified the fact that I had absolutely no clue what I was talking about. He was asking me questions about data structures and algorithms and how I'd model real life objects and items in code. I found myself literally speechless multiple times during the call. I had a few acceptable answers but mostly it was pretty embarrassing and I was sure I wouldn't move further. But he must've had some faith in me, and said he'd send me a code challenge to complete as soon as possible.

It was a Friday, and I started working on it immediately and through the weekend. It was very challenging. There were three individual challenges - they went something like this:

1. Make a simple html page to manage a todo list where users can input todos and check them off upon completion.

2. Model a public library with object oriented Ruby including Library, Shelf, and Book objects that has "enshelf" and "unshelf" methods and essentially keeps track of inventory.(The actual description was way more technical for this one.)

3. Generate and deploy a publicly available Rails app on Heroku that can create, edit, update, and destroy users. First name is required, and email must be valid. Add more features if it was easy.

The first challenge was not too difficult for me, because I'd been doing front end the most up to that point. I recall getting slightly hung up on a piece of the problem, but I think I solved it in the first night after the interview.

I then skipped to the third challenge knowing number 2 would take me much longer. There were a few tricky parts, but I made it work with time to spare for a quick Bootstrap UI and some funny pictures. You can find the code for that app [here on my Github](https://github.com/elliotec/codefellows_crud).

And finally, the public library. This was by far the most difficult part of the challenge and up to this point the most hardcore actual programming I'd ever been tasked to do, and it'd be a long time before I did anything that difficult again. This is the point where I realized that I'd been learning Rails without hardly learning any Ruby at all - hence the namesake "on Rails." I was determined to submit the challenges by Monday, and was sincerely worried that wasn't going to happen when I read the description of the challenge. So I immediately started looking around for tutorials that would help me with plain Ruby. I did [CodeSchool's Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org) which was very introductory and ultimately a waste of time when it came to what I was trying to accomplish.

I finally came across [Ruby in 100 Minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html) which is vastly different now than when I used it as a resource. At the time, it modeled a personal chef that made things for you, and the resulting program [looked like this](https://github.com/elliotec/100_min_ruby/blob/master/personal_chef.rb). It still is probably worth reading through, but it doesn't seem nearly as helpful for writing a real Ruby program as it used to be.

After going through that tutorial, I perused Github looking for real world examples I could use to model my program after. I found about 5 or 6 that I looked at several times and sort of made the brain connections I needed to translate into the public library. It took me from Saturday night until Sunday night to do this whole thing, and with minimal to zero sleep (I don't think this was necessary, I probably would have been fine if I took another day, but I was determined). [This is how it turned out](https://github.com/elliotec/cfruby_public_library/blob/master/cfruby_public_library.rb).

##Code Fellows

A bit to my surprise, I got in, and bought a one way ticket to Seattle arriving the day before the start of my cohort on January 6th. Finding a place to stay was extraordinarily easy (but also extraordinarily expensive compared to what I was used to in Utah) and I signed a 3 month lease in a tiny 10 x 10 apartment about a 20 minute walk from their facility.

The first day started out with a little bit of housekeeping/logistics, but then we were immediately thrown into the fire. So many things to configure and download, all in a whirlwind couple hours. Before the end of the day, we started our first assignment on behavior driven development in Rails. It was immediately and continuously super intense.

I learned <em>a lot</em> during my time at Code Fellows. I was spending no less than 100 hours a week totally immersed in code and the community. I would barely have enough time to take off my shoes at the end of each day before immediately passing out from expending all the energy I had.

The curriculum itself was very rigorous (most of my projects and assignments can be found on my Github if you're interested), but I feel some of the material we were taught was less impactful to me than what I learned from interacting with my peers and instructors and going to meetups almost every night, brushing elbows with some of the biggest names in the tech community and absorbing everything I could from everyone I could. I also had a great mentor from a local startup that really helped me solidify a few loose ends in the directions I was heading.

Another really useful aspect of the bootcamp was the increasing of our web presence. I never had a Linkedin account up until then, which I had come to find out is an absolutely essential tool in job searching. There was staff there tasked with helping us maximize the efficacy of our web presence and resumes, and doing mock interviews both technical and general.

During the course I was contacted with a few contract opportunities that I took, even though I really didn't have the time. One was as a personal tutor for someone with a MS in computer science learning Rails in a certificate program at UW. I had zero credentials, and I got paid the most money I'd ever charged up to that point to help a comp sci grad student pass a class in his own field of study. This put things in an interesting perspective - that the practical knowledge I'd been working on gaining might just be more useful than the expensive and dense theory taught in academia.

Toward the end of the bootcamp, I was asked by an instructor if I'd be interested in being a teaching assistant for a new month long class they were doing on the Fundamentals of Computer Science and Web Development. They were going to pay me and I still had a month left on my lease, so I jumped at the opportunity. It was taught in JavaScript. I learned so much by being put in a position where students looked up to me and I was tasked with being their first resource for help and knowledge.

I had a few interviews in Seattle, but even though I had made tons of friends the transient nature of my situation was a major barrier in landing a spot right away. A few students got jobs almost immediately after graduation, and others slowly trickled along roughly biweekly. We lost 3 classmates half way through the bootcamp, but most of us have jobs now or are making a decent living consulting.

##Startup Weekend

Something I really wanted to do before I left Seattle was participate in a [Startup Weekend](http://startupweekend.org/) event. There was only one more before my return to Salt Lake in April and it was unfortunately sold out. I got in contact with an instructor at Code Fellows who I knew was partnering with the event and he pulled a couple strings and got me a ticket as a designer. So I went and pitched my first startup idea which I made up on the spot and failed magnificently at.

I was baffled by how few developers were there when it was time to choose teams. Even though I had a designer ticket, it was clear my coding skills were needed (not to mention my design skills were nowhere near most of the others there). I was a hot commodity. There were several teams that were begging me to join them, offering one incentive or another, and at least one major altercation between two team leaders over me nearly resulting in a fistfight.

So I chose the team I chose, and had an absolutely great time. I met some really smart, great people. I wrote the back end of the app in Rails that connected to an iOS app. I learned so much from the iOS developer and remain good friends with him, I credit him with leading me to much interest and knowledge I have now.

Startup Weekend really put my skills to the limit, pushed me in ways I'd never been pushed before, and introduced me to long lasting relationships that remain beneficial. I also had a really interesting and legitimate project for my portfolio that would attract future employers.

##Returning Home

I got back to Salt Lake the first week of April and immediately started shotgunning applications to companies in SLC and Seattle.
