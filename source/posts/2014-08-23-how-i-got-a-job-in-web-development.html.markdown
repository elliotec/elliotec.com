## Why I'm writing this

I recently accepted a job offer as a web developer from a successful global company headquartered here in my home state of Utah. It wasn't the only offer I received, nor the highest paying. I chose it because I felt like I fit in with the team I'd be working with, and had a better opportunity for growth than at the others.


This post is an attempt to explain how, with only just over a year of experience programming and a degree in Psychology, I managed to find myself a position as a professional web developer. I'm writing in hopes that it will help anyone else along a similar path, or those who don't know where to start. This is by no means a surefire plan to get anyone a job in a year or ever. But maybe someone aspiring to become a web developer can take a few resources or find something useful here. 

## My first exposure

As far as I knew growing up, the Internet was made out of magic. I had taken apart my family computers out of curiosity many times but had never heard of HTML, or pondered the concept of what software development really was until after college. Most of the technical experience in my life was my enjoyment of building and breaking things, playing with Knex and Erector sets, and growing up with the Internet. Just after high school I was lucky enough to land a job as a contractor for my neighbor soldering circuit boards and electronics for various products he made.

That was a pretty cool job, but it certainly didn't make me want to study electrical engineering. I went into psychology thinking it would supplement my intent of going to medical school and becoming a psychiatrist. That dream died fast for numerous reasons, and I ended up rushing to finish my degree ASAP, then started work at Starbucks after finishing my student job upon graduation.

There are pros and cons to working at Starbucks, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to stick around forever. Career-wise I was open to whatever at the time and didn't have much direction. While poking around on some career sub on Reddit in January of 2013, I had vaguely been introduced to the idea of web development and coding by a particular post (which I have tragically not since been able to find), and it piqued my interest to research it further. Thats when I learned that I was basically "coding" when I followed an extensive process ([soon thereafter replaced by this](http://lifehacker.com/5830367/how-to-hack-your-wii-for-homebrew-in-five-minutes)) haphazardly copypasting weird long strings of symbols and watching the [Matrix-like falling green digital rain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_digital_rain) in college to mod my Wii so I could play all the games.

That same month I learned about [Linux](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and decided to install [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop) on an old Dell I inherited from my parents. In order to get things installed and working properly I had to open the command line and actually use Unix commands, some of them often enough to start understanding what they did and remembering them. I was just getting into Minecraft at the time and wanted my girlfriend to play with me, and I figured with a little googling it would be easy enough to setup a local server on that Ubuntu machine. It was, and I consider that my first real and aware exposure to programming.

## Finding the time

Over the next few months I dabbled in various tutorials on HTML and CSS but struggled finding time and motivation to just sit down and get through them. I attempted to get through the Codecademy courses multiple times but found them boring and purposeless. The idea sort of went to the back burner as I worked full-time and wanted to relax and enjoy my time off. I was doing just that at the climbing gym on June 1st when I clumsily stumbled off the mat at the base of the wall and put 100% of my weight on my ankle in a position that shattered the cartilage and broke the ligaments and generally destroyed everything it could. Somehow I didn't need surgery but the doctor said it had to be non-weight bearing for 12 weeks. 

So I called my boss and broke the news, she reminded me of one of the aforementioned "pros" of working at Starbucks: Short-term disability insurance. It got signed off no problem. The first couple weeks were mostly spent sleeping away the pain and playing through various video games, pretty much just lazing around. But one day when the Lortab wore off I was feeling very unproductive and bad about it, so I decided to set a goal of getting through those HTML and CSS Codecademy courses the next week. At the same time we moved into my girlfriend's parents' house while they were abroad so that eliminated rent and some other expenses for the few months I was out. I became acutely aware of how extremely fortunate I was to be in a position where I was essentially getting paid to chill at home and have 3 months of free time to spend however I wanted. 

This awareness led me to feel like I owed it to karma or whatever powers that were to spend a good chunk of my time out on productive endeavors and keep setting goals like the Codecademy one. I blew through those courses, still feeling annoyed with their seeming lack of purpose and context, but appreciated the introduction to something I knew I wanted to spend more time on. 

## Learning front end fundamentals

I soon asked the almighty Google for some of the top HTML & CSS resources. It wasn't long before I saw the book, aptly titled [HTML & CSS](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/), by Jon Duckett. I chose this book almost exclusively based on the way it looks. The design wowed me, and the content was just what I was looking for. Rather than the piecemeal abstractions and micro lessons on Codecademy, I found Duckett's book to be a refreshing whole-picture approach with real world examples. I went through it in a week and built finished a custom, useful website from scratch for the first time the following week. I credit this book with teaching me a lot of the foundational knowledge I needed to learn further concepts and build upon.

My next step was to search through my network for advice. I thought of everyone I knew, parsed through my Facebook friends, and found maybe 2 people I could contact that knew about web development or were involved in the industry. So I got in contact and told him about my interest and quickly got a response. He happened to be in a senior position at a very well known company but took the time to give me a little project to work on with a loose deadline. Still being in the first third of my confinement to the couch, I was able to spend two weeks working exclusively on this. I learned a lot about modern best practices and got some great career advice.

## Rails and a development environment

At this point I felt comfortable enough to tell my friends and family about my pursuit, and let them know that I was looking for work and projects. A good friend gave me the login to a tutorial series called [One Month Rails](http://onemonth.com) he bought but never found time for. I certainly had time for it, so I did it. 

This tutorial introduced me to a vast world that I'd never seen before. It guided me through setting up a development environment that consisted primarily of [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) and the command line, and helped me get a bunch of other tools set up. I learned about version control and [git](http://git-scm.com) (and by extension, [Github](http://github.com)) through repetition in the course, and got a grasp on most aspects of the tech stack in Rails. I finished it in about 2 weeks and had a fully functioning app replicating Pintrest, hosted on [Heroku](http://heroku.com). 

I used jQuery a little bit during the tutorial, which was a nice intro to the elusive beast that is JavaScript. I realized how useful and necessary it is and wanted to use some other plugins in my future projects.

## Starting a freelancing business

I was super excited about programming and my new prospects for income. I decided I wanted to start a freelance business doing this, and my first step was getting some more projects and clients behind me. The first few clients were not as hard to get as I had been led to believe. My family and friends already knew I was doing this, so I asked some of them if they needed a website.

I did one for free, one as a trade, and then started charging (not very much). My first three clients were close friends or family, and after that I indiscriminately offered my services to anyone and everyone. One of my first non-family/friend clients was an HVAC contractor that was fixing the furnace in the house I was renting at the time. He saw me working on a different project, asked what I was doing, and told me he needed a website. I gave him a cheap quote, and had another check in my pocket that day.

It was time to legitimize myself as a business; I had started making enough money to open up a business account and register a sole proprietorship. I finally got around to making myself a (pretty rudimentary) personal website and got my girlfriend's help in designing a logo in illustrator. We designed business cards for me around the same time and got a ridiculously cheap bulk order from FedEx. I still use them and they look like this:
