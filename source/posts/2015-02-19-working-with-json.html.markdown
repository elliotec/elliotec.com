##Presenting and Gathering Data

An integral part of front end development is working with data. The user interface is where data comes from in the first place, gathered by forms, other user input, or analytics tools. It's also where most data ends up - what good is all this gathered data unless we see it after being parsed and analyzed?

In this post I'm going to explore working with JSON data - primarily gathering and presenting it - across a few different JavaScript frameworks: [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Angularjs](https://angularjs.org/), and [React](
